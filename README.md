# LIPS-BMT
Research related to the Lung Injury Prediction Score in Patients Who Underwent Bone Marrow Transplantation

This research uses routinely collected variables in the pre-transplant, post-transplant and in-hospital domains to help populate a 22-point score (LIPS-BMT) score. 

Variable	Points
Pre-transplant domain (up to 10 points)	
  Allogeneic HCT	2
  Reduced-intensity conditioning	1
  DLCO Z-score < -2.5	1
  FEV1 Z-score < -2.5	1
  Pre-transplant AST > 60 U/L	1
  Pre-transplant hemoglobin < 8g/dL	1
  Pre-transplant leukocyte count < 3 Ã— 109 /L	1
  Diabetes Mellitus	1
  Chemotherapy with Thalidomide, Cisplatin, Methotrexate or Carboplatin	1
	
Post-transplant domain, pre-hospital (up to 1 point)	
  Oral steroid use	1
	
Post-transplant domain, within 24h of hospital admission (up to 11 points)	
  Sepsis	4
   + Septic Shock	2
  Pneumonia	2
  CARV (e.g. SARS CoV-2, influenza, RSV, rhinovirus)	2
  Bicarbonate < 21 mEq/L	2
  Median respiratory rate > 20 breaths / min	2
