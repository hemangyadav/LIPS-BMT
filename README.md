# LIPS-BMT
Research related to the Lung Injury Prediction Score in Patients Who Underwent Bone Marrow Transplantation

This research uses routinely collected variables in the pre-transplant, post-transplant and in-hospital domains to help populate a 22-point score (LIPS-BMT) score. The model assigns points as follows:


PRE-TRANSPLANT DOMAIN (up to 10 points)

  Allogeneic HCT				2
  
  Reduced-intensity conditioning		1
  
  DLCO Z-score < -2.5				1
  
  FEV1 Z-score < -2.5				1
  
  Pre-transplant AST > 60 U/L			1
  
  Pre-transplant hemoglobin < 8g/dL		1
  
  Pre-transplant leukocyte count < 3 Ã— 109 /L	1
  
  Diabetes Mellitus				1
  
  Chemotherapy with Thalidomide, Cisplatin, Methotrexate or Carboplatin			1
	
POST-TRANSPLANT DOMAIN (PRE-HOSPITAL, up to 1 point)

  Oral steroid use				1
	
POST-TRANSPLANT DOMAIN (IN-HOSPITAL, up to 10 points)

  Sepsis					4
  	+ Septic Shock				2
  
  Pneumonia					2
  
  CARV (e.g. SARS CoV-2, influenza, RSV, rhinovirus)		2
  
  Bicarbonate < 21 mEq/L					2
  
  Median respiratory rate > 20 breaths / min			2
  
  Opioids 							1
